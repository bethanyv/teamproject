We just decided:
- to place cards on board in correct areas ( one jpg now)
- ai later (possibly not at all if running out of time)

KRISTINE IN CHARGE OF:
Handle click event in right area - returns card in correct place of the matrix.
Each card should have an x and y coordinate when constructed. (see todo)
Resize on SFML? - whoever gets done first


BETHANY IN CHARGE OF:
Move function - logic for clicking an image, check match, if match, then add to pile. etc. flip again
Handle turn swapping
Rest of the logic stuff
Reiseze on SFML? - whoever gets done first

Will have lots of meetings in class and work office hours this week. Plan on ironing out the details of our presentation on Thursday.

ASK IN OFFICE HOURS:
How to get file names set as textures. So close and yet so far.
