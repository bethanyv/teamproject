- Met and discussed which graphics to use.
- Decided on SFML.

Both:
 - Go through SFML getting started tutorials and graphics module
 - Kristine still working on outline
 - Bethany still working on pictures
 	- 18 total images (16 unique, a back, and blank)

 The biggest roadblocks we encountered this week were illnesses, and midterms (aka life happened). We are both giving each other a pass for this week to finish our normal 330 project. We feel like this next class project will help us get more comfortable programming in C++ and implementing classes. We will work on our group project more after our class project is finished this next weekend/week.

 We assigned ourselves the task of going through the SFML tutorials and finishing up our assignments from last week. We hope that our project is approved since we got a 10/10 on the proposal . . . !
