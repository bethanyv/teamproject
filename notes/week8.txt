Kristine finally figured out how to install Ubuntu and 
got a hello world working with SFML. //cheer

Bethany filled in some constructor stuff in match.hpp and is almost done with the jpegs
for our cards.

Neither of us want to do threading, so hopefully we can avoid it.

We want to add a happy sound if we make a match and a sad sound if it's not a match.
But we want to get visualization done first.

TODO:

Card Array Setup - Kristine

jpeg's - Bethany

Board Set up - Kristine

Pile - Bethany

CardType, Move - Both

By next meeting we want to have some actual working game code written!
